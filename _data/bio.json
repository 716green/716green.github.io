    "summary": "I am a passionate software developer and self-starter. I have 10+ years of business and entrepreneurial experience across 3 separate businesses that I've founded, grown, and sold. I've employed hundreds of people across those previous ventures. As of 2019, I sold my final non-software company to pursue software engineering full time. Since 2019 I've devoted all of my time and energy to learning as many languages, and technologies, and frameworks as possible. I pride myself in my ability to learn programming related technologies quickly and efficiently",
